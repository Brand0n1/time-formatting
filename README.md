## Time Formatting

When formatting a date there is multiple diffrent patterns you can use. You can found out more about this by reading the [Java docs by Oracle]( https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html).

### Understanding the different components of date formatting
Lets start off by saying that the dashes `:` don't have anything to do with the actual formatting, and are just added in so it reads nicer.

- `HH` Using the capitol `HH` makes it so that the time will be in 24 hour format
- `hh` Using the lowercase `hh` makes it so that the time will be in 12 hour format
- `mm` Make sure to use lowercase `mm` in the date formatting for minutes. This is beacuse the capitol `MM` is used for the month.
- `ss` Using the lowercase `ss` will result in the total seconds in the minute
- `SS` Using the capitol `SS` will result in the total miliseconds
- `aa` Using the lowercase `aa` will result in getting AM or PM
